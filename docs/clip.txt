                        	        CLIP
                    	Command line clipboard handler
                            	    V0.1


    	CLIP is an utility for accessing clipboard from command line.
    It allows to put data from stdin to clipboard and print clipboard content
    to the stdout. It automatically detects that STDIN (STDOUT) is pipe or
    file and chooses appropriate mode. Each mode can be forced to allow
    program to work with character devices (console/COMx/etc). Because modes
    are not exclusive, it is possible to put this utility in the mid of pipe
    and get pipe content mirrored in clipboard.

    Examples:

    1. Put standard output of the application to clipboard:

    [C:\]dir | clip

    2. Pipe clipboard content to program standard input:

    [C:\]clip | more

	3. Pipe between programs:

    [C:\]dir | clip | more

	4. Force stdin:

    [C:\]clip -i
	type> Some test string
	^Z

	5. Force stdout:

    [C:\]clip -o
	Some test string
