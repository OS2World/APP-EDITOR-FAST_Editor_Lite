    Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How I can change FED colors?
A: FED colors are defined in FED.INI. Two alternative color sets are present
   inside comments. Perhaps one of them may better fit your needs or can be
   used as a starting point for your own set. You can see new colors right
   after change by pressing Alt+B keystroke.

Q: How to change some settings only for files with particular extension?
A: There is kbOpen pseudo key which is invoked for each opened file.
   FED.INI provided in FED package contains sample of such a macro
   which toggles state of the word wrap.

Q: Is FED supports autosave?
A: FED has no built-in support for autosave. Necessary function can be
   implemented using kbTimer pseudo key. This pseudo key is invoked every
   second.

Q: I'd like to invoke compiler from FED and then navigate through sources
   using information about errors and warnings produced by compiler.
   Is that possible?
A: FED.INI provided with package contains sample macro assigned to keys
   kbAltF8-kbAltF10 for some popular compilers. These macro are built around
   JumpLists feature of FED. Another interesting use of the JumpList
   is the macro assigned to kbAltV, which helps to navigate through C/C++
   sources.
