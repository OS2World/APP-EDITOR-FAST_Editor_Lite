  FED Configuration.

    FED is configured via simple ASCII file called FED.INI.
    This file contains all configurable parameters and key bindings.

    NOTE: Configurable parameters have default values, but key
          bindings have not. This means that FED does not work
          without INI file.

    Sample FED.INI file is included into package.
    You can use it as a base for your own configuration.
    FED.INI should be placed in the same directory as FED.EXE.


  Format of FED.INI

    FED.INI is a simple ASCII file which consists of variable assignments,
    comments, directives and empty strings. Comments and empty strings are
    ignored.

    At present FED recognizes only one directive:

    @include <file>

    Where <file> presented as a full or relative path to file
    in single or double quotes. If full path is used then file
    is searched at specified path. If relative path is specified then
    file is seached in current directory (or subdirectory under
    current directory). If file is not found there then it is
    searched in directory relative to that one in which FED.EXE is
    sored. For example:

	    FED.INI
    	    ...
            @include "fedconfig\samples.ini"
	        ...

        Current directory: D:\Work

        FED.EXE directory: C:\Tools\FED


    Following paths will be used to locate include file:

        D:\Work\fedconfig\samples.ini
        C:\Tools\FED\fedconfig\samples.ini


    Comment is a line started with ';','/' or '#' (without quotes).

    Variable assignments are just pairs <variable>=<value>.
    During processing of 'value' part back slash (\) is threated
    as a escape character. This allows to insert into 'value'
    special characters: '\n', '\r', '\t'. Other characters following
    backslash are inserted as is. If you need to insert backslash
    as is, it should be prepended by backslash, i.e. doubled:

	    \\ -> \
    	\\\\ -> \\

    and so on. Text of REXX macro is left unchanged, i.e. no translation
    of slashes is performed.

    Each configurable parameter have preferred name. Type of values which may
    be assigned to variable depends on variable. Some of them are numbers,
    some - strings.

    Numeric values may be decimal or hexadecimal.
    Hexadecimal values should be preceded by 0x, exactly as in C/C++.

    String value consists of one or more "segments".
    Each segment is quoted string.

    String values should be in single or double quotes.
    Quotes can't be escaped, so if you need to insert single quote, you
    should use it in double quotes quoted string, and if you need double
    quote, you should use it in single quotes quoted string.
    If you need to continue string on the next line, close quote, add ','
    at the end of line and open quote on the next line.
    These rules are very similar to those in REXX language but
    not completely equal.

    All configurable parameters and variable types are listed below

Short description of variables

  Variables "color.*" contain decimal or hexadecimal color values of
    different parts of editor. Colors are usual text mode character attributes,
    where high order nibble (high order 4 bits of byte) is responsible for
    background color, and lower order nibble - for foreground (character) color.
    Note, that input line in dialog is exactly the same object as full editor
    window, but with highlighting turned off. This causes full list of colors
    for input line to appear in list, but only part of them are really used
    (.default and .selection).

  Variable "editor.tabwidth" is responsible for tab character representation
    in space characters number.

  Variable "editor.hiliting" contains string which is responsible for how the
    editor will try to guess highlighting for opened file.
    This string have the following format:

        "MODE_NAME_1:*.mask1;*.mask2;...\n",
        "MODE_NAME_2:*.mask3;*.mask4;...\n".

    Note trailing '\n' sequence, it is used for delimiting highlighting mode
    strings.

  Variable "editor.untitled" contains default name for '.Untitled' or newly
    created files.

  Variables "cursor.shape.insert" and "cursor.shape.overwrite" contains
    numbers which are responsible for cursor shape. This number means relative
    (in percents of full cursor height) position from which shape starts. In
    other words  0 - means baseline, 100 - means full character size.

  Variable "editor.statusline" represents format in which editor will
    display status information. This string can contain following format rules:

    %n -  file number 0-9
    %r -+ row
    %c -+ col
    %d -+ current char (decimal)
    %x -  current char (hexadecimal)
    %h -  highlighting mode
    %a -  autoindent flag ('I'|' ')
    %u -  update flag ('*'|' ')
    %f -+ filename
    %t -  file type: Unix ('\0x0a' delimited)/DOS ('\x0d\x0a' delimited)
    %l -  placeholder for current codepage (LANG) setting
    %p -+ relative position in file
    %w -  word wrap status (' '|'W'|'M')

    For formats marked with '+' between % and format can be placed optional
    digit. This digit means minimal length of representation. Unused positions
    will be filled with zeroes. Other characters will be shown in the status
    line as is.
    By default this string has following contents :
        "L%3r:C%2c %h [%u%f]".

    This means:
        character L,
        followed by 3-digits number of row,
        semicolon,
        character C,
        followed by 2-digits column number,
        space,
        highlighting mode name,
        character '[',
        update flag,
        current file name,
        character ']'.
    Example of status line with default format line:
    'L001:C01 REXX [*C:\startup.cmd]'

    Default FED.INI specifies another format line:
        "(%p%%) L%4r:C%2c CHR(%xh,%3dd) [%h:%a:%u:%t:%30f] %l"

    Example status line for it (right now when I'm editing this file):
    '(42%) L0270:C05 CHR(20h,032d) [none:I:*:D:C:\Work\FOpS\config.txt°°°°°°°]'


  Variable "editor.helptext" contains text which will be shown for command
    'HelpScreen' (see below description of this command). Text should be
    formatted on 'per line' basis, and each line should be followed by '\n'
    sequence.

  Variable "editor.force.pm" - obsolete.

  Variable "editor.default.format" - set default format (Unix/DOS) for new
    files. Default (unassigned) value is 0, which means DOS file format.
    Any value other than 0 sets Unix file format.

  Variable "editor.ctrlbreak.action" defines what editor will do
    on the Ctrl+Break key press:

    0 - die with message box (default)
    1 - die without messages, all changes are lost
    2 - die with saving all changes
    3 - ignore Ctrl-Break

  Variable "editor.no.ea" disables writing EA's. If EA is present
    then it still used but not updated.

  Variable "editor.statuspos" if it is >0 tells FED to place
    status line at the top of screen.

  Variable "editor.verbose.search" to produce more messages during search.

  Variable "mouse.event.mask" defines a mask for mouse events which will
    be used to move cursor. Following events are recognized:
        MOTION                 0x01
        MOTION_WITH_BN1_DOWN   0x02
        BN1_DOWN               0x04
        MOTION_WITH_BN2_DOWN   0x08
        BN2_DOWN               0x10
        MOTION_WITH_BN3_DOWN   0x20
        BN3_DOWN               0x40

    Default value is 0x06, which is equal to MOTION_WITH_BN1_DOWN | BN1_DOWN.
    Setting variable to 0 disables processing of mouse events.
    Be careful with MOTION flag: enabling it will cause cursor movement
    on all mouse moves.

  Variable "mouse.sense.shift" makes moving cursor with mouse sesitive to
    Shift keys. If variable is not zero then moving cursor with mouse
    will unmark previously maked block if Shift key is not pressed and
    will mark block if Shift key is pressed.

  Variable "editor.default.wordwrap.state" determines default state
    of the word wrap feature and default state of the merge feature.
    Merge state determines if editor will merge remaider of the string which
    exceeds specified limit with next text in next line.
    Default state is used when file is opened or created new. Following
    values are recognized:

        Value Wrap     Merge
    	0     off       off
    	1     on        off
    	2     off       on
        3     on        on

    Default value of this variable is 2, so merge is on and word wrap is off.

  Variable "editor.default.wordwrap.margin" determines right margin of the
    text for word wrap. By default this value is set to 78.

  Variable "editor.indent.bracket"
  Variable "editor.autounindent" controls automated unindenting after
    pressing <Enter> in the string which follows some keywords. For example
    typing following sequence in C/C++/Java will not require involvement of
    <Tab> or cursor movement keys:

    if(foo == 1)
        i = 2;
    else
        j = 5;
    _

  Variable "editor.unindent.keywords" controls unindenting of
    keywords. Unindenting of keywords allows to place some keywords (such as
    'END' in REXX and PASCAL) on the previous tabstop.

  Variable "editor.unindent.brackets" controls unindent of the brackets:
    0 - disable unindent brackets
    1 - enable unindent for closing ( '}' ) curly bracket
    2 - enable unindent for both brackets (default)

  Variable "editor.flash.bracket" controls "flashing" of matching bracket
    when cursor points to bracket.

  Variable editor.word.delimiter contains string with characters which
    should be used as word delimiters.

  Variable editor.word.delete_ws controls behavior of DelWordLeft and
    DelWordRight commands.

  Variable editor.draw.eol enables or disables EOL displaying.

  Variable editor.unindent.spaces.only determines how editor will perform
    unindent operation. If this variable is set to 0, then old behavior
    is preserved (unindent by removing leftmost column in the block).
    Any other value will cause editor to unindent by removing only
    whitespace character in leftmost column of the block.

Key bindings

    Each key binding is a pair <key> = <action>
    Key name starts with 'kb' followed by zero or more
    special prefixes (Alt, Ctrl, Shift), followed by key name.
    Order of special prefixes: Alt, Ctrl, Shift
    This means that if you want to bind combination of keys Shift, Ctrl and
    key F10, pressed simultaneously, you should name this key kbCtrlShiftF10.
    Case of characters used in key name is ignored.

    All key names are listed below:

    kb0, kb1, kb2, kb3, kb4, kb5, kb6, kb7, kb8, kb9
    kbA, kbB, kbBackSlash, kbBksp, kbC, kbCenter, kbComma,
    kbD, kbDel, kbDiv, kbDown, kbE, kbEnd, kbEnter, kbEqual,
    kbEsc, kbF, kbF1, kbF10, kbF11, kbF12, kbF2, kbF3, kbF4, kbF5,
    kbF6, kbF7, kbF8, kbF9, kbG, kbGrDiv, kbGrEnter, kbGrMinus,
    kbGrMul, kbGrPlus, kbH, kbHome, kbI, kbIns, kbJ, kbK, kbL,
    kbLbracket, kbLeft, kbM, kbMinus, kbN, kbO, kbP, kbPgDown, kbPgUp,
    kbPoint, kbQ, kbQuote, kbR, kbRbracket, kbRight, kbS, kbSemicolon,
    kbSpace, kbT, kbTab, kbTilde, kbU, kbUp, kbV, kbW, kbX, kbY, kbZ

    Actions are sequences of quoted blocks of text and function names
    Quoted text can contain escape sequences '\t' (insert TAB character)
    and '\n' (emulates Enter key pressing).
    For quoting may be used either single (') or double (") quotes,
    but each block should be quoted with one type of them.
    Case of key names and actions is ignored

    Actions may be continued in the next line by adding ',' at the end of line.
  NOTE! key actions should not contain comments and continuation character (,)
    and should not be inside quotes.

Some notes about REXX API interface.

    FED REXX API is still under construction. There are some known bugs
    (especially with loading REXX code with curly brackets inside '{}'),
    but this API became more or less useful and short (very short) explanation
    below tries to fill some gaps in information about this interface.

    List of REXX API's exported by FED consists of two parts. First path
    is just the same functions as key macro functions described above.
    All of these functions have no parameters.

    fedAbort				fedBind
    fedBksp				    fedClose
    fedCopy				    fedCopyright
    fedCut					fedDel
    fedDelLine				fedDelToEOL

    REXX pool variable interface.

    REXX Pool is a feature that allows REXX scripts save and restore
    variables between calls. Also, almost all FED configuration variables,
	settings and state variables are accessible via this interface.
	Most of these variables are available for reading and writing,
	but some are available for reading only.

    fedVarSet             - store variable
    fedVarGet             - get variable value
    fedVarDrop            - drop variable

Detailed description.

rc = fedFillJumpList(stem, jumplist)

    stem - name of variable filled as follows:
            stem.jump_len       number of items in stem
            stem.XX.jump_header what to show in list box
            stem.XX.jump_file   file name
            stem.XX.jump_row    row to jump (0 - do not change position)
            stem.XX.jump_col    col to jump (0 - do not change position)

            Where XX is a number from 0 up to stem.jump_len-1.

            NOTE: all variables should be filled, even if they are not used.
                  For example: if there is no column to jump in list item 5,
                  variable stem.5.jump_col should be set to 0.

    jumplist - number of jump list to use. Range: 0-9

    rc - success, negative value - error.


rc = fedMsgBox(message)

    message - text of message to show.

    rc - success, negative value - error.


rc = fedOpenJumpList(jumplist)

    jumplist - number of jump list to use. Range: 0-9

    rc - success, negative value - error.


rc = fedOpenFile(filename)

    filename - file name to open or switch to.

    rc - success, negative value - error.


rc = fedInsChar(string)

    string - text to insert.
             Text will be inserted from current cursor position.

    rc - success, negative value - error.


rc = fedGetChar(row, [col], [len])

    row - line number in current file to get text
    col - start column for text to get
    len - length of substring to return

    rc - success, negative value - error.

    If len parameter is omitted, rest of string is returned.
    If col is omitted, full line is returned (starting from column 1).


rc = fedFind(pattern, flags[, replace])

    pattern - pattern to look for
    flags   - find flags
    replace - string to replace with

    rc - success, negative value - error.

    Supported flags:

    B - Find in backward direction
    G - Global search (from beginning to end or vice versa, depending on B flag)
    I - Ignore case
    E - Regexp. Pattern is regular expression
    R - Replace found string with 'replace'

    If pattern is a regular expression, then this function can substitute
    variables in 'replace' string with parts of found string which match
    subexpressions in pattern. Each variable begins with '$' char followed
    by digit 0-9. Variable $0 substitutes entire matching string.
    Variables $1-$9 substitutes 1st-9th subexpression respectively.
    For example:

    Pattern: ^(#[a-z ]+)([A-Z_0-9 ]+)(0x[0-9a-fA-F]+)(.*)
    String : #define ONE_1       0x000   text
    Replace: ($0)($1)($2)($3)($4)
    Result : (#define ONE_1       0x000   text)(#define )(ONE_1       )(0x000)(   text)


rc = fedInput([prompt[, row [, col]]])

    prompt - name for the input window
    row    - suggested row for the prompt
    col    - suggested col for the prompt

    rc - user input is returned, otherwise empty string is returned.


rc = fedGetClip()

    rc - clipboard content


rc = fedSetClip(newtext)

    newtext - text to put in clipboard


rc = fedMenu(row, col, item1, ..., itemN)

    rc - 1...N      selected meny item on return
    rc - 0          Esc was pressed
    rc - negative   parameter error

    Displays a pop-up menu at specified location and process user
    input until choice is made or Esc key is pressed.
    To make text in menu item 'highlighted' bracket it with tilde (~)
    Also, first letter of highlighted text becomes a hotkey.
    For example:
        " ~T~est "
    This menu item will have letter T highlighted and will be
    select if user will press letter T on keyboard.


rc = fedVarSet(name[, value])

    if value is provided then variable is set,
    otherwise variable is deleted. Internal variables can't be
    removed and some can't be set. List of internal variables
    is provided below.


rc = fedVarGet(name[, default])

    if variable does not present in pool, then it is created
    and default value is returned if it is specified.
	List of internal variables variables is provided below.


rc = fedVarDrop(name)

    Drops a set of variables whose names begins with 'name'
    Internal variables can't be dropped.
